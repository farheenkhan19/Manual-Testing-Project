# Manual-Testing-Project
ðŸŒŸ I am excited to share my latest Manual Testing project on OpenCart, an open-source e-commerce platform.

ðŸ”¹ About OpenCart:
   OpenCart is an online store management system developed by OpenCart Limited. It is built with PHP, uses MySQLi/PostgreSQL for database management, and HTML for the frontend. 
   It supports multiple languages and currencies and is freely available under the GNU General Public License.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
   In this project, I explored different modules of OpenCart and created detailed test scenarios and test cases for:

   User Registration, Login, Logout, Forgot Password
   Product Search, Compare, and Display Page
   Add to Cart, Wish List, and Shopping Cart etc.

  My responsibilities included:
  âœ” Designing test scenarios, test cases, and checklists
  âœ” Performing functional, UI, and regression testing
  âœ” Logging and tracking defects to ensure quality
  âœ” Strengthening my skills in test planning, defect reporting, and end-to-end testing workflows

ðŸ”¹ Key Deliverables:

     Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)
     Test Plan 
     Test Scenarios
     Test Cases, Reviews & RTM
     Environment Setup & Build Deployment
     Test Execution Results
     Bug Reports & Tracking
     Sanity Testing, Re-testing & Regression Testing
